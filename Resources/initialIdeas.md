# Initial Ideas and Thoughts
This document summarizes some initial ideas for the development of the fish trap project.

## Tech:
I(Bryce) plan on continuing to use python and jupyter notebooks while relying on javascript elements for interactivity where needed. This guarantees existing infrastructure  and presentation methods will work.

## Gamification:
Once an initial mathematical model is provided I see a few ways to “gamify” the learning.

### Idea 1: Build a trap without resources limitations
User inputs dimensions + location of fish trap and depending on input they are told how many fish they catch that season or tidal shift. This is the simplest and most feasible.

### Idea 2: Build a trap with resource limitations
Similar to idea one but the fish trap design is inhibited by some resource.

### Idea 3: Population modeling
The user can build a trap and after the trap is deployed the trap catches “healthy” and “small” fish. The user is prompted to return some fish, the population next season is dependent on which fish were harvested. This one incorporates themes of ecological management found in the Húy̓at fish trap website.

### Idea 4: Story-Adventure
The user is presented with a scenario of building a fish trap and is presented with a series of binary options such as one would have in a “choose your own adventure” time story. Revolving around the fish trap and the model. This would require someone more knowledgeable than myself to create the “story” being told. I feel time limitations  make this option infeasible. 

## Format:
I plan to follow the format of the Basket Weaving project. First present information about fish traps, then some simple aspects of the model and allow the user to interact with the model in a limited capacity,  finally  allowing the user some freedom and to interact with the model in a more gamified way.

## Other Matters
### Limitations:
1. Animations, outside of the most trivial, will have to be out of scope. It would eat up all the hours.;
2. I have used 36 hours so far on updating the Basket Weaving project;
3. I will be splitting my time between this project and other comitments until 01 August 2020.

###Questions:
1. What will Laura's role be moving forward?
2. How many hours exactly am I aloted for this?
...* Confirm the final product is due before September?
...* What will be the plans for meetings going forward?
...* Should we have specific check ins when so many hours are used?
3. When can I expect to have an initial model?
...* What will its inputs and outputs be?

For point 1: I suggest Laura continue in her current role providing me guidance as an end-user/educator/stake-holder through informal meetings.

For point 2: My understanding is I will have 200 hours, I suggest we have some form of formal check in every 40 hours (every two weeks).
