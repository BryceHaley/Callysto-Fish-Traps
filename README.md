# Interactive media for fish trap modelling

#### This is the second project of this type the first being a notebook
on  [Coast Salish Basket Motifs](https://github.com/cchauve/Callysto-Salish-Baskets)

This project will allow users to "build" a fish trap. The parameters of
the fish trap built will be fed into a mathematical model and the user
will then be able to visually see how effective the trap is based on the
modelling.
