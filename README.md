This project will allow users to "build" a fish trap. The parameters of
the fish trap built will be fed into a mathematical model and the user
will then be able to visually see how effective the trap is based on the
modelling. We then evaluate the relationship between quota (how much fish 
to harvest) vs population size for pink salmon over the course of 10 years.
